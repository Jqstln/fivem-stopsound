# fivem-stopsound
Let's say a hacker joined your server, and he starts 
playing an annoying sound that everyone can hear.

Using this script in your server, you can stop this sound
from playing.

This script will look for a sound that is playing, and it will prevent from happening.

Big thanks to Future Roleplay (Dutch FiveM Server) for sharing this code to the public,
and I've made into a script. https://discord.gg/frp
